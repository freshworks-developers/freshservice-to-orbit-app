fdk validate throws error "[ERROR] Exception occured while validation: Cannot read property 'product' of undefined"
- Which file this error is from?
- What is missing?

Super confusing behaviour of return; in iparams.js
- How do I throw a error message to one specific iparam ?
- What does this line even mean? `return <validation criteria> ? ‘<Success Message>’: ‘<Error Message>’;`
